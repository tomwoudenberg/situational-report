A timely epidemiological analysis of notification data is important in times of a COVID-19 pandemic. This requires continuous analysis of notification data. A commonly used tool is Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Excel is generally non-reproducible, can be time consuming and is prone to error. RMarkdown is a tool that allows creating reports that include analytical code. The advantage of Rmarkdown is that the report that can consist of written text, figures and tables, and can be easily updated when new data is used. The objective of this work was to develop automated analyses and reporting of COVID-19 data.
